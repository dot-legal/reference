# Our Approach

## Why standardize?

Academics and industry leaders have suggested standardizing certain aspects of contracts for decades.  The cost of contracting has been steadily rising, and in recent years, the sheer volume of legal documents has exploded.

Very few businesses are truly conducting commerce in a unique way.  While products themselves may be innovative, businesses continue to either sell products or services in tried and true ways.  The truth is, there is significant overlap between one contract and another.  This holds true whether we're talking about different types of contracts, different arrangements, or even different entities.

Think about industries that have successfully implemented certain standards.  We use the term "net 30" for payments, and talk about "free on board (FOB)" in shipping.  By standardizing contracts, we can directly affect the contract life cycle and get to an agreement quicker and cheaper.  We wouldn't waste time arguing over semantics and running up the legal bill.  Indirectly, standard contracts will simplify the landscape and lead to cheaper and better legal services.  For example, legal advice related to a standard contract will only require comments for customized aspects.

## Why haven't we already done it?

We can choose to be cynical and believe self-interested parties have convinced us to draft unique contracts for each and every transaction.  However, I believe the truth is more mundane; we simply haven't had good tools.

Clause libraries have been a critical tool for ages.  You can find dusty books filled with standard provisions in law libraries across the globe.  A well intentioned lawyer looks at the provision and proceeds to make a minor adjustment.  It is simply human nature to make a mark.  Propogated through a firm or to other businesses, the series of changes eventually creates an entirely new clause.  The result is the necessary exercise of rereading even the simplest and most uncontroversial of terms over and over and over.  We should be leveraging basic technology to fix this flaw.

## How does reference.legal help?

Our goal is to get rid of the standard legalese in our contracts.  We fully recognize businesses will charge different prices and offer different terms for different products, but there is absolutely no reason we need to keep reviewing clauses like Counterparts, Headings or even Confidentiality.

Working with our tireless early-testers, we repeatedly simplified our vision until reference.legal looked like something familiar to virtually all lawyers.  It is a clause library placed online.  It is not imposing or difficult to learn.  However, it accomplishes one key objective: it prevents the enterprising lawyer from making meaningless modifications and guarantees the integrity of the text for all future lawyers.

We provide standard clauses.  We provide the gentlest entry for legal professionals to adopt a new standard.  And we provide the platform to collaboratively shape and improve the standard going forward.  We hope that lawyers will think about documents differently, to focus on what really matters.

## Why now?

The foundation is finally set. You'll be hard pressed to find a lawyer who does not have easy access to a modern web browser.  Shockingly, this was not true even a few short years ago in our extremely traditional profession.

Furthermore, technology giants are increasingly including hyperlinks in their contracts, creating a trail of precedents to really cement in the acceptance of such documents by the courts.

## What is GitHub and why are we using it?

GitHub is a mature platform relied on by millions of software developers and tens of thousands of companies to store their most valuable asset; source code.

The similarities between the needs of software developers and lawyers are striking.  By leveraging GitHub, we can quickly launch reference.legal and guarantee reliability that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  In the meantime, we can also use the GitHub interface as a temporary solution while we work through the reference.legal roadmap.  For example, GitHub has issue trackers, notification emails, and other useful features.

While it is not geared towards legal professionals, you can sign up for a free GitHub account and watch our repository at https://github.com/dot-legal/reference.
