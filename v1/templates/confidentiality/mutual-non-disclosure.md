# Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement Template Terms

## Definitions

Each of the parties under this document disclosing Confidential Information will be referred to as the "**Discloser**", and each of the parties under this document receiving Confidential Information will be referred to as the "**Recipient**".

"**Confidential Information**" will mean all information of a Discloser that is disclosed or furnished to a Recipient or its Representatives by or on behalf of a Discloser, whether in written, oral, electronic, web-based, or other form, and includes any copies, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, notes, interpretations, or other documents prepared by a Recipient which contain, reflect, or are otherwise generated from information that:

1. a reasonable person under the circumstances would recognize as confidential in nature; or
2. that Discloser marks or otherwise makes clear its intention to keep such information confidential.

## No Obligation to Disclose

Nothing in this document obligates any party to disclose any particular information (including Confidential Information) to the other parties. Nor will any party be obligated to enter into any further agreement with the other parties.

## Obligation of Confidentiality

During the term, the Recipient will hold Confidential Information in confidence with at least the same care Recipient uses for its own Confidential Information, and in no event, less than a reasonable standard of care.

## Permitted Disclosures

Confidential Information will be used solely to further the Purpose, and Recipient will limit disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, directors, officers, counsel, consultants, affiliates or contractors (the "**Representatives**") who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality arising to a level similar to this document and are notified that such information is Confidential Information and must be kept in confidence in accordance with this document.  Prior to disclosing Confidential Information to any consultant or contractor, Recipient will ensure that an executed non-disclosure agreement is in place with protections that are substantially similar to the protections in this document.  Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this document by its Representatives.

Recipient may also disclose Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable law or regulation or with any requirement imposed by any governmental or court order but only to the extent required.  Prior to making any such disclosure, Recipient will, to the extent legally permissible, immediately notify the Discloser of the required disclosure upon receipt of a governmental or court order, and cooperate with the Discloser in making a good faith effort to limit disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.

## Exceptions

The obligations of confidentiality under this document will not apply to any information that:

1. was previously known to Recipient free of any obligation to keep it confidential;
2. is or has become publicly known, through no wrongful act of any of the parties;
3. was received from a third party who the Recipient reasonably believes is under no obligation of confidence; or
4. was independently developed by Recipient without use of Confidential Information.

## Breach of the Agreement

The Recipient will notify the Discloser immediately upon discovery of any breach of this document and will cooperate with the Discloser in every reasonable way to help the Discloser regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorized disclosure and use.  The Recipient will use its best efforts to enforce the confidentiality obligations of this document against its Representatives during and after the term of their engagement.

## Return or Destruction of Confidential Information

Upon termination of this document or upon request by Discloser, Recipient will return or destroy all applicable copies of and derivatives of the Confidential Information of the Discloser.  Recipient agrees to confirm the return or destruction in writing if requested.  Recipient may retain Confidential Information solely for the purpose of ensuring its compliance with a law, regulation or professional standard, provided that the it remains subject to all obligations of confidentiality outlined in this document.

## Retention of Rights

All Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Discloser.  The disclosure of Confidential Information will not constitute any grant to the Recipient, express or implied, of any rights to or under the Discloser's patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks or any other intellectual property rights.

## No Warranties

No warranties are made and no responsibility or liability is or will be accepted by any party in relation to or as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information or in relation to or resulting from the use of the Confidential Information.  ***All Confidential Information is provided "as is".***

## Equitable Relief

The parties acknowledge that the disclosure of a Discloser's Confidential Information in violation of this document may cause the Discloser irreparable harm and that any breach or threatened breach of this document by the Recipient entitles the Discloser to seek injunctive relief, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies available to it.
