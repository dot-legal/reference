## Intellectual Property

### Ownership

Even though the Client is not under any obligation to use the Project, the Contractor acknowledges that the Project is being created by the Contractor for use by the Client.  At all stages of development, the Project (including all concepts, ideas, copies, notes and other materials related to it) will be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Client.

The Contractor acknowledges that the Project is considered a "work made for hire" or a "work made in the course of employment", where such doctrines exist.  If, for any reason, the Project, as an output of the Contractor's services, is determined at any time not to fall under such doctrines, the Contractor hereby assigns to the Client all right, title, and interest (including all copyrights, renewals, and extensions), and any and all resulting rights and benefits in the Project.  The Contractor will reasonably cooperate with any Client requests to perform further acts as required to perfect or confirm the ownership rights outlined in this [](#ownership).

### Waiver of Moral Rights

The Contractor irrevocably waives, and agrees never to assert, any moral rights in the Project.  At the Client's sole and absolute discretion, the Client may make any changes to the Project it wishes.

## Contractor

### Independent Contractor

The Contractor acts as an independent contractor to the Client.  

### Representations and Warranties

The Contractor represents and warrants to Client that, to the best of its knowledge, the concepts, ideas, and other materials produced for the Purpose do not infringe on any patent, copyright, trade secret, or any other personal or proprietorial rights of others, and that the Contractor has the unencumbered right to enter into this document.

### Indemnities

The Contractor will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to legal fees, attributable to a breach of [](#representations-and-warranties) made by any third party other than the Client or the Client's representatives.

1. a reasonable person under the circumstances would recognize as confidential in nature; or
2. that Discloser marks or otherwise makes clear its intention to keep such information confidential.

Confidential Information will be used solely to further the Purpose, and Recipient will limit disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, directors, officers, counsel, consultants, affiliates or contractors (the "**Representatives**") who have a need to know such Confidential Information and who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality arising to a level similar to this document and are notified that such information is Confidential Information and must be kept in confidence in accordance with this document.
