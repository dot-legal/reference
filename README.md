# reference.legal

A framework to draft shorter legal documents.  Please visit our homepage at [https://reference.legal/](https://reference.legal/).

## Introduction

Every clause and document from reference.legal's online clause library can be hyperlinked.  By linking to our standard clauses in your documents, you can dramatically simplify them.  Hide templated legalese and focus on what really matters.

## Quick Start

1. Select a standard clause from our library at [https://reference.legal/clauses/](https://reference.legal/clauses/).
2. Copy the URL and incorporate it into your legal document.  For example:  `Incorporate https://reference.legal/v1/provisions/general/counterparts/.`
3. Send out your shorter and simpler document!

## Key Benefits

1. Link to our clauses to reference templated text and **shorten your documents**.
2. Absolutely **no setup or training required**.  URLs are already familiar ground.
3. **Draft by exception**.  Call out changes after the reference so your reader doesn't have to sift through dozens of pages to find one single change.
4. Merely curious?  **Use as much or as little as you want**.  Replace a simple [Counterparts clause](https://reference.legal/v1/provisions/general/counterparts/) or an entire [Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement](https://reference.legal/v1/forms/confidentiality/mutual-non-disclosure/).
5. Read our templates once and **re-use it anywhere with any counterparty**.

## Examples

Incorporate our standard headings clause by linking to it:

`Incorporate https://reference.legal/v1/provisions/general/headings/.`

If you want to make any modifications, just call it out immediately after the link:

`Incorporate https://reference.legal/v1/provisions/general/force-majeure/ however, "reasonable efforts" may not, under any circumstances, exceed 30 calendar days.`

If you want to lock the text to exactly what you see, add a date stamp (YYYY-MM-DD format) to the end of your link.  Otherwise, we may make adjustments to keep up with best practices.  Text that is not locked down will be considered "amended from time to time" and will be deemed to be accepted by both parties.

`Incorporate https://reference.legal/v1/agreements/non-disclosure-agreements/mutual-non-disclosure-agreement/2020-01-08.`

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Are reference.legal documents legally enforceable?

Yes.  Agreements are enforceable in any form of media so long as all parties understand, agree and intend to be legally bound by it.  Legal documents already make heavy use of links to corporate policies, external notices, etc.  Functionally, reference.legal is no different, just rigorously organized for scale.

### 2. How does reference.legal differ from a clause library?

A clause library is private to the party drafting a document and only benefits the drafter.  There is no standard source of truth, and no guarantee the drafter has not modified the language.  As such, the counterparty does not save any time at all.  They are forced to read the document from top to bottom no matter which clause library is used and whether the language has been modified or not.

### 3. How can I contribute?

The reference.legal GitHub repository is located at [https://github.com/dot-legal/reference/](https://github.com/dot-legal/reference/).  GitHub offers a number of tools to make suggestions or to call out issues.  However, our roadmap includes additional tools in the [https://reference.legal/](https://reference.legal/) website to make it easy for anyone to comment and make suggestions.
